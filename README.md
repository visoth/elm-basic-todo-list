# Todo list

This project is an example of a basic TODO list written in ELM.

Some remarks:

- It was bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
- It uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io) as a CSS Framework, through the [Elm-Bulma](https://github.com/surprisetalk/elm-bulma) library
- It is composed of a Main file and a Todo module file, to demonstrate of to use views composition
- This is my very first app in ELM, it may not be fully optimized

## Requirements
 - Node >=8
 - create-elm-app 
 
```
yarn global add create-elm-app
```

## Run the application

```
elm-app start
```
